# 06 Weather Dashboard

## Description
A **weather dashboard** that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS using the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) and using `localStorage` to store any persistant data.

### Motivation

### Learning Targets
This exercise encompassed building a JavaScript page using Bootstrap, increasing familiarity with setTimeout() and setInterval() functions, traversing the DOM to update elements as the quiz progressed, and passing items into and out of local storage.

## Core Objectives Met

1. IN PROGRESS: When the user visits the page, they should be presented with a weather dashboard with form inputs.
2. IN PROGRESS: When a city is searched, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and the city is added to the search history.
3. IN PROGRESS: When current weather conditions for a city are viewed, the user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
4. IN PROGRESS: When the UV index is viewed, the user is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
5. IN PROGRESS: When future weather conditions for a city are viewed, the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
6. IN PROGRESS: When a city from the search history is clicked, the user is again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
